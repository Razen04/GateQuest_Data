Semaphore $full$ denotes the number of available slots in the buffer, for the producer to write to. The placeholder variables, denoted by $P$, $Q$, $R$ and $S$, in the code below can be assigned either $empty$ or $full$. The valid semaphore operations are: $wait()$ and $sigmal()$.$$\\begin{array}{|l|l|}\\hline \\text{Producer:}  &  \\text{Consumer:}  \\\\\\hline  \\text{do \\{} & \\text{do \\{} \\\\  \\quad\\text{ wait (P);} & \\quad\\text{ wait (R);} \\\\  \\quad\\text{ wait (mutex);} & \\quad\\text{ wait (mutex);} \\\\  \\quad \\text{ //Add item to buffer} & \\quad \\text{ //consume item from buffer} \\\\  \\quad\\text{ signal (mutex);} & \\quad\\text{ signal (mutex);} \\\\  \\quad \\text{ signal (Q);} & \\quad\\text{ signal (S);} \\\\  \\text{\\}while (1); }&  \\text{\\}while (1);} \\\\   \\hline \\end{array}$$Which one of the following assignments tp $P$, $Q$, $R$ and $S$ will yield the correct solution?$P: full,  \\ \\ \\ Q:full, \\ \\ \\ R:empty, \\ \\ \\ S:empty$$P: empty, \\ \\ \\ Q: empty, \\ \\ \\ R:full, \\ \\ \\ S:full$$P: full, \\ \\ \\ Q:empty, \\ \\ \\ R:empty, \\ \\ \\ S:full$$P: empty, \\ \\ \\ Q:full, \\ \\ \\ R:full, \\ \\ \\ S:empty$",
