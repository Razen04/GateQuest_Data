The load-store instructions take two clock cycles to execute.\nThe designer of the system also has an alternate approach of using the DMA controller to implement the same transfer. The DMA controller requires $20$ clock cycles for initialization and other overheads. Each DMA transfer cycle takes two clock cycles to transfer one byte of data from the device to the memory.\nWhat is the approximate speed up when the DMA controller based design is used in a place of the interrupt driven program based input-output?",

Also, the EX stage is split into two stages (EX1, EX2) each of latency $1$ ns. The new design has a total of eight pipeline stages. A program has $20\\%$ branch instructions which execute in the EX stage and produce the next instruction pointer at the end of the EX stage in the old design and at the end of the EX2 stage in the new design. The IF stage stalls after fetching a branch instruction until the next instruction pointer is computed.
