All operations, including incrementation of the PC and the GPRs, are carried out in the ALU. Two clock cycles are needed for a memory read operation — the first one for loading the address in the MAR and the next one for loading data from the memory bus into the MDR.  \n\nThe instruction `call Rn, sub` is a two-word instruction. Assuming that the PC is incremented during the fetch cycle of the first word of the instruction, its register transfer interpretation is:  <br>Rn ← PC + 1  <br>PC ← M[PC]<br>The minimum number of CPU clock cycles needed during the execution cycle of this instruction is: __________",
