The cache controller contains the tag information for each cache block comprising of the following.\n\n$1$ valid bit\n$1$ modified bit\nAs many bits as the minimum needed to identify the memory block mapped in the cache.\n\nWhat is the total size of memory needed at the cache controller to store meta-data (tags) for the cache?",
