        "question": "Consider the diagram shown below where a number of LANs are connected by (transparent) bridges. In order to avoid packets looping through circuits in the graph, the bridges organize themselves in a spanning tree. First, the root bridge is identified as the bridge with the least serial number. Next, the root sends out (one or more) data units to enable the setting up of the spanning tree of shortest paths from the root bridge to each bridge. Each bridge identifies a port (the root port) through which it will forward frames to the root bridge. Port conflicts are always resolved in favour of the port with the lower index value. When there is a possibility of multiple bridges forwarding to the same LAN (but not through the root port), ties are broken as follows: bridges closest to the root get preference and between such bridges, the one with the lowest serial number is preferred.Consider the spanning tree $B1, B5, B3, B4, B2$ for the given connection of LANs by bridges, that represents the depth first traversal of the spanning tree of bridges. Let host $H1$ send out a broadcast ping packet.

Also, all links are symmetric and the cost is identical in both directions. In each round, all nodes exchange their distance vectors with their respective neighbors. Then all nodes update their distance vectors. In between two rounds, any change in cost of a link will cause the two incident nodes to change only that entry in their distance vectors.\nThe cost of link $N2-N3$ reduces to $2$ (in both directions). After the next round of updates, the link $N1-N2$ goes down. $N2$ will reflect this change immediately in its distance vector as cost, $\\infty$. After the NEXT ROUND of update, what will be the cost to $N1$ in the distance vector of $N3$ ?",

Once the routes have been stabilized, the distance vectors at different nodes are as follows.\nN1: $(0, 1, 7, 8, 4)$\nN2: $(1, 0, 6, 7, 3)$\nN3: $(7, 6, 0, 2, 6)$\nN4: $(8, 7, 2, 0, 4)$\nN5: $(4, 3, 6, 4, 0)$\nEach distance vector is the distance of the best known path at that instance to nodes, $N1$ to $N5$, where the distance to itself is $0$. Also, all links are symmetric and the cost is identical in both directions. In each round, all nodes exchange their distance vectors with their respective neighbors. Then all nodes update their distance vectors. In between two rounds, any change in cost of a link will cause the two incident nodes to change only that entry in their distance vectors.\nThe cost of link $N2-N3$ reduces to $2$ (in both directions). After the next round of updates, what will be the new distance vector at node, $N3$?",
